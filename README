By default, the numbers can be in two formats, (11)xxxx-xxxx or (11) xxxx-xxxx.
The program needs as input one file with the database definitions, with the following format:

{
  'host':'foo',
  'database':'bar',
  'username':'foo',
  'password':'bar',
  'tables':{
    'table_1':['update_field_1', 'update_field_2', 'update_field_n'],
    'table_n':['update_field_1', 'update_field_2', 'update_field_n']
  }
}

Usage: python ddd11.py input_file
