#MySQLDigito9

This script inserts the 9th digit in mobile phones numbers from the brazilian area with DDD 11 stored in mysql databases.
By default, the numbers can be in two formats, (11)xxxx-xxxx or (11) xxxx-xxxx.
The program needs a input file with the database definitions, with the following format:

{
  'host':'foo',
  'database':'bar',
  'username':'foo',
  'password':'bar',
  'tables':{
    'table_1':['update_field_1', 'update_field_2', 'update_field_n'],
    'table_n':['update_field_1', 'update_field_2', 'update_field_n']
  }
}

Usage: python ddd11.py input_file
